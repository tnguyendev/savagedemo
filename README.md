## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

## Thoughts:

First project working with node.js and express! Looks a bit scary at first but then you sort of realize it's a lot of copy pasting and changing around a few routes. I'm really really loving the css I did for this. Our group had to fix the delete button and the thumbs down button, but I just decided I wanted to css and make this simple little project cute so here we are. I'm happy with it.
